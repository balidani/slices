Key questions, todo list:

* Algorithm is *very* slow without optimization
  * Try optimizing it in Java?
  * Switch to C++ completely?
  * Should the models be pre-rendered instead?
  * How computation heavy is the whole algorithm? 
  * Do some analysis!
* A name for the project is required
  * A logo would also be nice, probably *after* we have a name
