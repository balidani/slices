slices
======

Key questions, todo list:

* Algorithm is *very* slow without optimization
  * Try optimizing it in Java?
  * Switch to C++ completely?
  * Should the models be pre-rendered instead?
  * How computation heavy is the whole algorithm? 
  * Do some analysis!
* There is a bug when we interpolate a cube's slices
